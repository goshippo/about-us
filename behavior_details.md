## Core Behaviors

### Care about...
"Give a ship" - This is the most important behavior (listed in no particular order)

* Care about the craftmanship of your work.
* Care about Shippo.
* Care about your coworkers and their success.
* Care about standards and quality.
* Care about learning and growing your skills.

### Unearth Value
"Failure leads to success" - Figure out what the customer wants through continuous iteration and delivery

* Understand the "why" first; Why are we working on this and how does it impact the user or customer?
* Think "[how](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mvp.png)" can I do this in incremental steps and  provide useful functionality along the way.
* It's about the journey; expect __failure__ along the way as it will take many iterations to find the right solution (if ever)
* Practice on small bug fixes first before graduating to large features or projects

### Confer not defer
"Question the [HiPPO](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39633499)" - Your opinions matter and its important to voice them and have meaningful discussions

* Ideas are selected based on merit not the size of your title or the length of your tenure
* Understand how your work will/can impact others
* Its ok to disagree, the key is everyone is heard and then we commit to one direction.
* Pyschological safety is built around your ability to express your opinions without fear, so if you don't say it, how will anyone know?

### Be Authentic
"there's no killing it" - we are more than our work, we are human and we're fallible
* Transparency is the best polic
* Frame "failure" and "weakness" as learning and growth opportunities
* Its ok to feel :pensive: or :cry: or :angry:, talk to someone and we can work through it together
* There's no "killing it"; startups are built on trial and error and solving problems.. forever
* Being successful is a healthy intersection of work and life
     
### Seek excellence through learning
do or do not, there's no try - continuous improvement is how we level :arrow_up:

* Don't pick a path only because its easy or comfortable
* There are multiple ways to do something, explore them    
* Seek guidance from others (inside or outside work), don't have the "invented here" mentality
* Give yourself the time and freedom to try new things
* Figure out how to apply things you've read to your day to day
