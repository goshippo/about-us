Here's a list of behavior warning signs to show that the company is not supporting you.  We've found that once you get to these behaviors, its very hard to get out.  As leadership, it's `our job` to make sure you don't get here and if you do, we're committed to working with you to make it better.

### Lack of Safety

* You don't feel like people listen to you and have stopped offering suggestions
* You believe only leadership can make decisions
* You want to be promoted to be heard
* You can only talk about the problems at work in the shadows
* You don't have anyone to turn to with your issues at work
* You are anxious at meetings with leadership
* You're anxious when leadership pings you

### Work Anxiety

* You are constantly getting pulled in different directions by your work
* You feel unending pressure to deliver
* You don't know why you are working on something
* You don't know what the customer wants
* You haven't learned anything new recently
* You don't have time to clean up tech or process debt
* You are working nights and weekends
* You haven't taken a vacation in awhile
* You don't get recognized for your work

### We've made you jaded

* You listen to "culture" or "core values" talks with disdain
* You think leadership sucks
* You're just here for the benefits
* You're just here because your friends are
* You're learning new technologies only to advance your career
* You're here to collect a paycheck
