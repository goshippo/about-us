## Hiring @ Shippo (WIP)

At Shippo we look at 3 dimensions for a software engineering candidate

* __Core values and [behaviors](README.md) fit__ - do you approach software engineering with the same mindset as we do, do you share similar values about customers and work?
* __Technical Ability__ - can you problem solve and build code that would work in production
* __Diversity of Thought__ - how do you approach problems, how has your past experiences shaped your thinking

### General Flow

We have a pretty straight forward process.  We aim to make it speedy, painless (as possible) while still making sure you and Shippo vet each other appropriately.  We will also adapt the process based on your skills, so we will try to tailor some questions more towards your skillset.

Here's a general outline of the process:

* You've applied [here](https://goshippo.com/jobs/)!
* Manager/Recruiter Phone Screen (15-30 mins)
  * Chatting about experience, goals and general communications assessment. We are interested in what you are looking for in your next job.
* Technical Phone Interview (15-45 mins)
  * Screening of candidate based on technical ability. We will also gauge your interest in various teams at Shippo.
* Onsite (3-4 hours)
  * Each interview has 1 or 2 primary problem solving questions and 1 or 2 questions about your technical or teamwork experience.
  * Tech Interview 1, Software Engineering - Whiteboard coding question focused using data structures and simple algorithm.  Preferably real code.
  * Tech Interview 2, System Design - Whiteboard design question focused around systems interaction, scalability, and error handling.
  * Tech Interview 3, Software Design - Whiteboard software design focused on encapsulation, and data-driven application design.
  * Founder Chat - Discuss background on Shippo, core values/behavior fit
  * Manager Wrap-up & Feedback - We want to gather feedback about how the interview went and about the process (what went well, what could be improved).  We'll also provide you any feedback that we may have.
* Internal Recap
* Decision

This whole process can happen pretty quickly, depending on your availability, so overall time frame may be only __1-2 weeks__ from application to decision.

### Helpful Notes

We understand that on-site technical interviews can be stressful.  Here are some of our principles that might alleviate the stress:

* The problems that we ask are real life problems that we have solved in the past.  We made simpler versions of them to fit within the alloted time. The idea is to give you a sense of what day-to-day work is like at Shippo.
* We are not looking to evaluate your answer against a gold standard. Instead, we are looking to get to know you, e.g. how you approach problems, and how you communicate solutions.
* Be yourself! We are trying to get to know you, and we want you to get to know us. The more natural you are, the more we can gauge whether you'll love working at Shippo.

Also, take a breath and relax, we're not trying to trick you or give you ridiculous puzzle or math problems :).
