## Hiring @ Shippo (WIP)

At Shippo we look at 3 dimensions for a software engineering candidate

* __Core values and [behaviors](README.md) fit__ - do you approach software engineering with the same mindset as we do, do you share similar values about customers and work?
* __Technical Ability__ - can you problem solve and build code that would work in production
* __Diversity of Thought__ - how do you approach problems, how has your past experiences shaped your thinking

### General Flow

We have a pretty straight forward process.  We aim to make it speedy, painless (as possible) while still making sure you and Shippo vet each other appropriately.  We will also adapt the process based on your skills, so we will try to tailor some questions more towards your skillset.

Here's a general outline of the process:

* You've applied [here](https://goshippo.com/jobs/)!
* Manager/Recruiter Phone Screen (30-45 mins)
  * Chatting about experience, goals and general communications assessment.
* Technical Phone Screen (60 mins)
  * Screening of candidate based on technical ability.  This will also be used to determine who should be paired up with you during your onsite.
* Onsite (3-4 hours)
  * Tech Interview 1, Coding & Code Review - Whiteboard Coding question focused around general coding and simple algorithm.  Preferrably real code.
  * Tech Interview 2, System Design - Whiteboard Coding question focused around interacting with APIs and a database.  Psuedo code and perhaps SQL.
  * Tech Interview 3, Software Design & Architecture - Whiteboard software design focused around classes, data model and architectures.
  * Founder Chat - Discuss background on Shippo, core values/behavior fit
  * Manager Wrap-up & Feedback - We want to gather feedback about how the interview went, and give us feedback about the process (what went well, what could be improved).  We'll also provide you any feedback.  We also like to know what you are looking for in the job
* Internal Recap
* Decision

This whole process can happen pretty quickly, depending on your availability, so overall time frame may be only __1-2 weeks__ from application to decision.

### Helpful Notes

We understand that on-site technical interviews can be stressful but we're looking for some specific things while conducting our interviews, they are:

* technical problem solving
* situational technical problem
* situational behavioral problem

Also, take a breath and relax, we're not trying to trick you or give you ridiculous puzzle or math problems :).
