# Shippo's Mentoring Program (WIP)

We want to make it easy for Shippos to mentor each other on any topics that might be interesting.  To facilitate this, we've created a simple template to track interests between people.  This is dubbed a "bam/sam" or a "be a mentor / seek a mentor" file.

The key to this is its a `knowledge sharing program` over a strict "mentor vs mentee" program.  Hence, we want to pair two people who can learn from __each other__.
