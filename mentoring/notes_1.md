## First SMP Process

First discussed: 4/2/2019   
Participants: Daria and Bruce

### Intro Meeting (35 mins)

Date: 4/19/2019

In the first SMP intro meeting, we went through our bams and sams with each other, and determined the best things to mentor each other on.  Daria decided that the best thing to help Bruce with is learning React and Redux.  Bruce determined the best thing to mentor Daria on is how to create a lightweight process to help engineers execute but still be able to focus on quality.  Also, while chatting about one of Daria's Sams, knowledge sharing among engineers, both Bruce and Daria decided to work on it together as a joint project to determine how we can do better share deeper knowledge (beyond the good design docs and wiki we have in Confluence).

It was also determined that while its best to have a 1 month candence for sync up, its best to create a "personal OKR" for the work that the mentees are going work on, and then make it part of their 1x1 discussions with their respective managers.
