## THOUGHT IN PROGRESS - Requires Team Collaboration

## Welcome to Shippo's About Us

### Our Vision

To become the leading shipping platform for commerce worldwide.

### Our Mission

To help businesses succeed through shipping.

### Our Values

* __Customer First__ - We put our customers first in everything we do. We will succeed if we deliver value and high quality products to our customers. We walk the extra mile to delight our customers with excellence and expertise.    
* __The Front Page Test__ - We act with moral integrity and assume the best of each other. We trust each other to do the right *thing.    
* __Be Entrepreneurial__ - We depend on each other’s work to be successful as a whole. We are proactive and resourceful, taking ownership and seeking to empower others.

## Engineering's Mission

`To engineer user-centric shipping experiences that grow the Shippo network. `

## Our Culture

`The system in which the team executes, makes decisions and behaves as a collective group`
(sorry it's not about our free lunches, great benefits and awesome office :wink:)

First we need to define a common language so we all know what we're talking about:

>To achieve __long term company success__, teams should be in the __learning zone__ and exemplify our core values by __adopting core behaviours__ and making decisions by __measuring what matters__.

---

### The Learning Zone

Our two core tenants are trying to unlock the two powerful dimensions of team (and company) success:
  * [Psychological Safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)
  * Intrinsic Motivations through [Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us).
  
Adopting core behaviors and measuring what matters helps us reach the "learning zone".

### Adopting Core Behaviors

These individual behaviors will make our team stronger

Behavior  | Oogway Says: | Re-enforces Core Value:
--------- | ----------- | ------------
[Care about](https://github.com/batmany13/shippo-about-us/blob/master/behavior/care.md) | Excel at your craft | Customer First, Front Page Test
[Unearth Value](https://github.com/batmany13/shippo-about-us/blob/master/behavior/value.md) | Iterate to success | Customer First, Be Entrepreneurial, We haven't won yet
[Confer not defer](https://github.com/batmany13/shippo-about-us/blob/master/behavior/confer.md) | Your opinion matters | Be Entrepreneurial, We haven't won yet
[Be Authentic](https://github.com/batmany13/shippo-about-us/blob/master/behavior/authentic.md) | There's no "killing it" | Be Kind, The Front Page Test
[Learn From Others](https://github.com/batmany13/shippo-about-us/blob/master/behavior/learn.md) | Free your mind | Be Entrepreneurial, We haven't won yet

### Measuring what matters

<img src=rsrcs/shipmypants.gif>

To ensure we're working on the right thing, we use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and CFRs (Continuous, Feedback, Recognition) to guide and super charge the team.

OKR's 4 Key Parts:

- Focus - pick 2-3 objectives that really matter
- Align - make sure every person and team across the company are aligned
- Track - see if the results are bearing fruit, change course as needed
- Stretch - aim high and stretch your goal and your mind to accomplish great things

CFRs to encourage and guide the team

- Continuous - Constant coaching and mentoring
- Feedback - Give specific and timely feedback
- Recognition - celebrate the wins and the learnings

## Putting it in practice

<img src=rsrcs/keep_calm.jpeg><br/>

Phew, thats a lot to take in.  So how do we take all these concepts and put it in practice at Shippo?  By making it part of our day to day activities like these:

### Give you time and space

- [Kanban](kanban.md) model to limit WIP so engineers have time to do their work right.
- [1x1s](1x1.md) focused on you.
- A week dedicated a quarter for [hackathons](hackathon.md)
- We expect work/life balance.  You should have your weekends and vacation to recharge.  When we have company holidays, we take them off.
- On-call that's reasonable; we currently do deploys during work hours and you are rarely paged off hours.
- Tech debt is paid at constant intervals and all projects accounts for this time.

### We really care about culture

- Interviews and hiring based on culture fit, ranking higher than technical ability
- Performance reviews based on core behaviors and how you've grown
- Your responsibilities [increase](growing.md) as you practice and embody these values.
- [1x1s](1x1.md) are focused around you and how we can help you learn and grow and build up your behavioral muscles
- We will talk about the concepts until you're :dizzy_face:, er.. I mean :heart:ing it :joy:

### Growth mindset

- It starts at the top - from our founders to senior leadership to individual contributors, we have a growth mindset and are humble enough to know we don't know everything.
- Feedback is ingrained - from 1x1s to 360 reviews to [Reboot circles](https://www.reboot.io/) to celebrating our wins and coaching and mentoring all the time.
- We put our :money_with_wings: where our mouth is, we pay for you to learn and you have a yearly self improvement budget that we expect you to spend!
- Company wide OKRs are communicated broadly and time is spent to get them right.  And if they aren't right, we throw them away.
- Aspirational OKRs are evaluated by our ability to hit 70% of the targets, and we conduct post mortems to figure out how to improve it next time
- This repo itself is a living document that can change and morph as we grow
