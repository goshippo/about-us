## Shippo's Mission

<img src=https://goshippo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shippo-lockup-black-web-1.png width=30% height=30%>

`Shippo empowers retailers, e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, logistics providers, and more with the building blocks they need to succeed with shipping.`

## Our Team Culture

Defined as `The system in which the team executes and behaves as a collective group` (sorry it's not about our free lunches, great benefits and awesome office :wink:)

The three major parts can be summarized by: _Foundational Thinking, done right through core behaviors, measured by what matters_

### Foundational Thinking

The two powerful dimensions of team success is [Psychological Safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) and Intrinsic Motivations through [Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us).  Getting to the "learning zone" is what we strive for here.

### Done right through Core Behaviors

 * __Care about...__ - This is the most important behavior (listed in no particular order)
      * Care about the craftmanship of your work.
      * Care about Shippo.
      * Care about your coworkers and their success.
      * Care about standards and quality.
      * Care about learning and growing your skills.

 * __Unearth Value__ - Figure out what the customer wants through continuous iteration and delivery
      * Understand the "why" first, Why are we working on this and how does it impact the user or customer?
      * Think "[how](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mvp.png)" can I do this in incremental steps, by providing useful functionality along the way.
      * It's about the journey; expect __failure__ along the way as it takes many iterations to find the right solution (if ever)
      * Practice makes perfect

 * __Confer not defer__ - Your opinions matter and its important to voice them and have meaningful discussions
      * Ideas are selected based on merit not the size of your title or the length of your tenure
      * Understand how your work will/can impact others
      * Its ok to disagree, the key is everyone is heard and we commit to one direction
      * How will anyone know how you feel if you don't say it?

* __Be Authentic__ - Be who you truly are, the good and the bad
    * Transparency is the best policy
    * Frame "failure" and "weakness" as learning and growth oppurtunities
    * Its ok to feel :pensive: or :cry: or :angry:, talk to someone and we can work through it together
    * There's no "killing it"; startups are built on trial and error and solving problems.. forever
    * We have lives outside of work, understanding the whole self matters and so does work/life balance
     
 * __Seek excellence through learning__ - Don't get complacent, find new ways to do things
      * Don't pick a path just because its easy or comfortable
      * There are multiple ways to do something, explore them    
      * Seek guidance from others (inside or outside work), don't have the "invented here" mentality
      * Give yourself the time and freedom to try new things

### Measured by what matters

We use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and CFRs (Continuous, Feedback, Recognition) to guide and super charge the team to success
- Focus - pick 2-3 objectives that really matter
- Align - make sure every person and team across the company are aligned
- Track - see if the results are bearing fruit, change course as needed
- Stretch - aim high and stretch your goal and your mind to accomplish great things

Use CFRs to establish a learning culture
- Continuous - Constant coaching and mentoring
- Feedback - Give specific and timely feedback
- Recognition - celebrate the wins and the learnings

## Putting it in practice

All this sounds great, but would be just another cliche "feel good" document if we didn't put the time and effort behind to implement it.  First off, the above is not "easy".  There's a lot going on and takes alot of practice to get good at it.  We're just starting our journey here so we're constantly learning how we can improve.

- It starts at the top - from our founders to senior leadership, we have a learning attitude and always looking to grow our skills, become self-aware of our faults and look to grow ourselves.
- Benefits that match our beliefs - we believe in vacation, we believe in taking time for family, we believe in investing in your education.
