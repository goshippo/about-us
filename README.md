## Engineering's Mission

`To engineer user-centric shipping experiences that grow the Shippo network. `

## Our Development Culture

Defined as: `The system in which the team executes, makes decisions and behaves as a collective group`
(sorry it's not about our free lunches, great benefits and awesome office :wink:)

First we need to define a common language so we all know what we're talking about:

>To achieve __long term company success__, teams should be in the __learning zone__ and exemplify our core values by __adopting core behaviours__ and make decisions by __measuring what matters__.

---

### The Learning Zone

<img src=rsrcs/learning_zone.jpeg>

We believe that the two important elements to unlocking team (and company) success are:
  * [Psychological Safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) - _This means ensuring that no one is penalized if they ask for help or admit a mistake._
  * Intrinsic Motivations and accountability through [Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us).
  
Adopting core behaviors and measuring what matters helps us reach the "learning zone".

**Note - The above image was taken from this [blog](https://peakon.com/blog/workplace-culture/psychological-safety) which is based on [research](https://hbr.org/2008/07/the-competitive-imperative-of-learning) by Amy Edmondson

### Adopting Core Behaviors

These individual behaviors will make our team stronger :muscle:

Behavior | Re-enforces Core Value
--------- | ------------
Code it like you're going maintain it forever | Customers For The Win
Dare greatly | We Are Passionate About Hard Challenges
Be kind to yourself | We Are High In Conscientiousness
Ask Why? | Customers For The Win, We Are Optimists

Read more [details](behavior/README.md) and some [anti-patterns](antipattern.md).

### Measuring what matters

<img src=rsrcs/shipmypants.gif>

We establish company wide OKRs and then spend each quarter working on building a bottoms up approach to defining team OKRs that will help move the needle.  The current 2020 OKRs are as follows:

1. Make sure that existing Shippo customers have a user experience they rave about
2. Make sure the foundation is in place for future growth in the SMB high volume segment
3. Maintain growth trajectory

The second part is having CFRs (continuous, feedback, recognition), which is using [1x1s](1x1.md), our OKRs software and giving each other meaniful and timely [feedback](feedback.md) to help reach our goals.  When key results don't make sense anymore, we adjust them, and we're always looking to improve them.

## Putting it in practice

<img src=rsrcs/keep_calm.jpeg><br/>

Phew, thats a lot to take in.  So how do we take all these concepts and put it in practice at Shippo?  By making it part of our day to day activities like these:

### Support doing things well

- Tightly coupled product and engineering collaboration to ensure we're building the right things based on available resources and reasonable time estimates
- Exploring [Kanban](kanban.md) to help limit WIP so engineers have time to focus on quality and shipping to production
- [1x1s](1x1.md) focused on you.
- [Hackathons](hackathon.md) to try new things and have fun doing it
- We expect work/life balance.  You should have your weekends and vacation to recharge.  When we have company holidays, we take them off.
- On-call that's reasonable; we have a formal rotation, and do deploys during work hours and even if you're on-call, you are rarely paged off hours.
- Tech debt is paid at constant intervals and all projects accounts for this time.

### We really care about making Shippo a great place to work

- Interviews and hiring based on culture fit, ranking higher than technical ability
- Performance reviews based on core values and behaviors and how you've grown
- Your responsibilities [increase](growing.md) as you practice and embody these values.
- [1x1s](1x1.md) are focused around you and how we can help you learn and grow and build up your behavioral muscles
- We will talk about the concepts until you're :dizzy_face:, er.. I mean :heart:ing it :joy:
- A week long New Hire Orientation to help you learn about Shippo

### Growth mindset

- It starts at the top - from our founders to senior leadership to individual contributors, we have a growth mindset and are humble enough to know we don't know everything.
- Feedback is ingrained - from [1x1s](1x1.md) to 360 reviews to [Reboot circles](https://www.reboot.io/) to celebrating our wins and coaching and [mentoring](mentoring/) all the time.
- We put our :money_with_wings: where our mouth is, we pay for you to learn and you have a yearly self improvement budget that we expect you to spend!
- Company wide OKRs are communicated broadly and time is spent to get them right.  And if they aren't right, we throw them away.
- Aspirational OKRs are evaluated by our ability to hit 70% of the targets, and we conduct post mortems to figure out how to improve it next time
- Employee Resource Groups to help Shippos learn and grow
- This repo itself is a living document that can change and morph as we grow
