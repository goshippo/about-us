<img src=https://goshippo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shippo-lockup-black-web-1.png width=30% height=30%>

`Shippo empowers retailers, e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, logistics providers, and more with the building blocks they need to succeed with shipping.`

## Our Team Culture

Defined as `The system in which the team executes and behaves as a collective group` (sorry it's not about our free lunches, great benefits and awesome office :wink:)

The three major parts can be summarized by: _Foundational Thinking, done right through core behaviors, measured by what matters_

### Foundational Thinking

The two powerful dimensions of team success is [Psychological Safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) and Intrinsic Motivations through [Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us).  Getting to the "learning zone" is what we strive for here.

### Done right through Core Behaviors

 * __Care about...__ - This is the most important behavior as all other behaviors depend on this
      * Care about the craftmanship of your work.
      * Care about Shippo.
      * Care about your coworkers and their success.
      * Care about standards and quality.
      * Care about learning and growing your skills.

 * __Unearth Value__ - Figure out what the customer wants through continuous iteration and delivery
      * Understand the "why" first, Why are we working on this and how does it impact the user or customer?
      * Think "[how](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mvp.png)" can I do this in incremental steps, by providing useful functionality along the way.
      * It's about the journey; expect __failure__ along the way and it takes many iterations to find the right solution
      * Practice makes perfect

 * __Confer not defer__ - Everyone's opinions matter and its important to having meaningful discussions
      * Ideas are selected based on merit not the size of your title or the length of your tenure
      * Understand how your work will/can impact others
      * Its ok to disagree, the key is everyone is heard and we commit to one direction
      * How will anyone know how you feel if you don't say it?

* __Be Authentic__ - Be who you truly are, the good and the bad
    * Transparency is the best policy
    * Frame "failure" or "weakness" as learning and growth oppurtunities
    * Its ok to feel :pensive: or :cry: or :angry:, talk to someone and we can work through it together
    * There's no "killing it"; startups are built on trial and error and solving problems.. forever
    * We have lives outside of work, understanding the whole self matters and so does work/life balance
     
 * __Seek excellence through learning__ - Don't get complacent, find new ways to do things
      * Don't pick a path just because its easy or comfortable
      * There's always multiple ways to do something, explore them    
      * Seek guidance from others (inside or outside work), don't have the "invented here" mentality
      * Give yourself the time and freedom to explore

### Measured by what matters

Use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and CFRs (Continuous, Feedback, Recognition) to guide and super charge the team to success
- Focus
- Align
- Track
- Stretch

Use CFRs to establish a learning culture
- Continuous - Constant coaching and mentoring
- Feedback - Give specific and timely feedback
- Recognition - celebrate the wins and the learnings
