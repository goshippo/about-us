<img src=https://goshippo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shippo-lockup-black-web-1.png width=30% height=30%>

`Shippo empowers retailers, e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, logistics providers, and more with the building blocks they need to succeed with shipping.`

## Our Team Culture

Defined as `The system in which the team executes, makes decisions and behaves as a collective group` (sorry it's not about our free lunches, great benefits and awesome office :wink:)

First we need to define a common language so we all know what we're talking about.

So let's start with the summary: _Foundational Thinking, done right through core behaviors, measured by what matters_ :boom:

### Foundational Thinking

<img src=https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5c682520f6d8a07482e12970/1078x765/d21d65a8818d6d392c3e27e69fd699e3/image.jpeg.jpg width=50% height=50%>

The two powerful dimensions of team success is [Psychological Safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) and Intrinsic Motivations through [Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us).  Getting to the "learning zone" and applying what you learned to your day to day is what we strive for here.

### Done right through Core Behaviors

 * __Care about...__ - This is the most important behavior (listed in no particular order)
      * Care about the craftmanship of your work.
      * Care about Shippo.
      * Care about your coworkers and their success.
      * Care about standards and quality.
      * Care about learning and growing your skills.

 * __Unearth Value__ - Figure out what the customer wants through continuous iteration and delivery
      * Understand the "why" first; Why are we working on this and how does it impact the user or customer?
      * Think "[how](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mvp.png)" can I do this in incremental steps and  provide useful functionality along the way.
      * It's about the journey; expect __failure__ along the way as it will take many iterations to find the right solution (if ever)
      * Practice on small bug fixes first before graduating to large features or projects

 * __Confer not defer__ - Your opinions matter and its important to voice them and have meaningful discussions
      * Ideas are selected based on merit not the size of your title or the length of your tenure
      * Understand how your work will/can impact others
      * Its ok to disagree, the key is everyone is heard and then we commit to one direction.
      * Pyschological safety is built around your ability to express your opinions without fear, so if you don't say it, how will anyone know?

* __Be Authentic__ - we are more than our work, we are human and we're fallible
    * Transparency is the best policy
    * Frame "failure" and "weakness" as learning and growth opportunities
    * Its ok to feel :pensive: or :cry: or :angry:, talk to someone and we can work through it together
    * There's no "killing it"; startups are built on trial and error and solving problems.. forever
    * Being successful is a healthy intersection of work and life
     
 * __Seek excellence through learning__ - continuous improvement is how we level :arrow_up:
      * Don't pick a path only because its easy or comfortable
      * There are multiple ways to do something, explore them    
      * Seek guidance from others (inside or outside work), don't have the "invented here" mentality
      * Give yourself the time and freedom to try new things
      * Figure out how to apply things you've read to your day to day

### Measured by what matters


Intel's actual OKRs referenced in "Measure What Matters"

<img src=rsrcs/intel_corporate.png width=30% max-height=50%>
<img src=rsrcs/intel_eng.png width=30% max-height=50%>

We use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and CFRs (Continuous, Feedback, Recognition) to guide and super charge the team to success
- Focus - pick 2-3 objectives that really matter
- Align - make sure every person and team across the company are aligned
- Track - see if the results are bearing fruit, change course as needed
- Stretch - aim high and stretch your goal and your mind to accomplish great things

Use CFRs to establish a learning culture
- Continuous - Constant coaching and mentoring
- Feedback - Give specific and timely feedback
- Recognition - celebrate the wins and the learnings

## Putting it in practice

<img src=rsrcs/keep_calm.jpeg width=20% height=20%>

Phew, thats a lot to take in.  So how do we take all these concepts and put it in practice at Shippo?  By making it part of our day to day activities like these:

### Give you time and space

- [Kanban](kanban.md) model to limit WIP so engineers have time to do their work right.
- [1x1s](1x1.md) focused on you.
- A week dedicated a quarter for [hackathons](hackathon.md)
- We expect work/life balance.  You should have your weekends and vacation to recharge.  When we have company holidays, we take them off.
- On-call that's reasonable; when you're on-call, you're on call, when you're not, you're not.
- Tech debt is paid at constant intervals and all projects accounts for this time.

### We really care about culture

- Interviews and hiring based on culture fit, ranking higher than technical ability
- Performance reviews based on core behaviors and how you've grown
- Your responsibilities [increase](growing.md) as you practice and embody these values.
- [1x1s](1x1.md) are focused around you and how we can help you learn and grow and build up your behavioral muscles
- We will talk about the concepts until you're :dizzy_face:, er.. I mean :heart:ing it :joy:

### Growth mindset

- It starts at the top - from our founders to senior leadership to individual contributors, we have a growth mindset and are humble enough to know we don't know everything.
- Feedback is ingrained - from 1x1s to 360 reviews to [Reboot circles](https://www.reboot.io/) to celebrating our wins and coaching and mentoring all the time.
- We put our :money_with_wings: where our mouth is, we pay for you to learn and you have a yearly self improvement budget that we expect you to spend!
- Company wide OKRs are communicated broadly and time is spent to get them right.  And if they aren't right, we throw them away.
- Aspirational OKRs are evaluated by our ability to hit 70% of the targets, and we conduct post mortems to figure out how to improve it next time
- This repo itself is a living document that can change and morph as we grow
