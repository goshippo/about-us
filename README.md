The two powerful dimensions of team success is [Psychological Safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) and Intrinsic Motivations through [Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us).  Getting to the "learning zone" is what we strive for here.

### Done right through Core Behaviors

 * __Care about...__ - This is the most important behavior as all other behaviors depend on this
      * Care about the craftmanship of your work.
      * Care about Shippo.
      * Care about your coworkers and their success.
      * Care about standards and quality.
      * Care about learning and growing your skills.

 * __Take small purposeful steps__ - We are doing some great things, but we can only get there one commit at a time.
      * Understand "what" the problem statement is and how it impacts the user or customer
      * Think "[how](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mvp.png)" can I do this in incremental steps, by providing useful functionality along the way.
      * Expect __failure__ along the way and feel the freedom to experiment to find the right solution
      * Practice makes perfect

 * __Confer, not defer__ - Everyone's opinions matter and its important to having meaningful discussions
      * Ideas are selected based on merit not the size of your title or tenure
      * Listen with empathy, understand the other's point of view
      * Understand how your work will/can impact others
      * Its ok to disagree, the key is everyone is heard and we commit to one direction
     
 * __Seek learning and be uncomfortable__ - Don't get complacent, find new ways to do things
      * Don't pick a path just because its easy or comfortable
      * Pick the right tool for the job
      * There's always multiple ways to do something, explore them    
      * Seek guidance from others, don't have the "invented here" mentality
