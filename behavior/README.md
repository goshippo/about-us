[_The best teams focus on fundamental skills_](https://medium.com/swlh/leaders-be-the-dumbest-in-the-room-777060a38d86)    
[In this world, HOW we do anything means everything.](https://www.howistheanswer.com/how/)

We are currently revamping our core behaviors by going through team driven exercises.  We've held 3 meetings so far, each with a specific topic and below is the rough collection of ideas from the team.  We still need to synthesize them into a succinct message and list of core behaviors.  Our original list is located [here](original.md)

## Code it like you're going maintain it forever

Taking ownership of your work, and being accountable and caring about your craft as well as how it will affect your co-workers and company.

## Think with a wartime mentality

Don't get comfortable, and be willing to take risks and being fearless wth your work.

## It's the journey not the destination

As a counterbalance to "wartime", is to learn to take your time, do things right and do things without sacrificing your life.

## Let's look at our favorites again

The 4th session is to determine if there are core behaviors we want that showed up in previous sessions.  So we all listed our favorites that we didn't think were captured by the first 3.  The two that "won", were "asky why" and "win as a team".  We will expand on these as well, and also determine if they belong with other core behaviors.
