# Care about

`Excel at your craft`

This is arguably the most important core behavior, and where all other behaviors feed off of.  Specifically, we are trying to promote intrinsic motivators, but it is incumbent on Shippo to create the environment which all Shippos can care about our mission, be given the time and space to do good work and grow and learn.

## Patterns

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all possible behaviors but should give you a general idea of how we view core behaviors.

* You see a billing task is not running properly, and you spend time to investigate it and fix it properly and make sure it works in production appropriately (`customers and business`)
* While working on a feature, you notice that a function can be refactored and make the code easier to read and maintain.  You spend the extra hour to do this, and leave the code better than when you found it. (`craftmanship`)
* You noticed that the QA process where people rotate in can be improved, so you automate it a little bit to make it easier for your teammates to complete their QA tasks. (`co-workers`)
* You add or update the README.md of the code base to instruct other engineers how to build and run your service (`standards and quality`)
* You include notes in your code pointing at decisions you might have made (`standards and quality`)
* You spend time finding meetups and conferences that match your interests or is out of your comfort and invest in your learning (`learning and growing`)
