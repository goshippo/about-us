# Care about

`Excel at your craft`

This is arguably the most important core behavior, and where all other behaviors feed off of.  Specifically, we are trying to promote intrinsic motivators, but it is incumbent on Shippo to create the environment which all Shippos can care about our mission, be given the time and space to do good work and grow and learn.

## Patterns

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all possible behaviors but should give you a general idea of how we view core behaviors.

What | Examples 
-----|------ 
Care about Shippo | You see a billing task is not running properly, and spends the requesite time to fix it properly and make sure it works in production appropriately
Care about the craftmanship of your work | While working on a feature, you notice that a function can be refactored and make the code easier to read and maintain.  You spend the extra hour to do this, and leave the code better than when you found it.
Care about your coworkers and their success | You spent 
Care about standards and quality |
Care about learning and growing your skills |
