### Teams on a Mission

<img src=../rsrcs/team_mission_exercise.jpeg>

At Shippo we're made up of several teams with dedicated team members looking to build product and capabilities to fulfill our company [vision](https://goshippo.com/about/) and mission.  So, we have been running "design thinking" type exercises to come up with team based missions and figure out the What/Who/How/Why of the team.

Name | Boring Name | Description | Mission
-----| ----------- | ----------- | --------
Viserion | Merchant Experience | Focused on retention and customer experience for active Shippo customers | TBD
[Saiyan](https://github.com/goshippo/getting-started/blob/master/teams/growth.md) | Growth | Focused on new user registration, activation and fraud prevention | `We help merchants succeed by making their Shippo experience both intuitive and delightful`
Hydra | Core | Focused on high performance, high scale core services such as rating engine, data pipeline, tracking services | TBD
C-OPS | Carrier Ops | | Focused on integrations with our carrier partners such as USPS, Fedex, UPS, DHL and others | TBD
