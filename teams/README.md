### Team based Missions

<br/>
At Shippo we're made up of several teams with dedicated team members looking to build product and capabilities to fulfill our company vision and mission.  We followed a "design thinking" type process to come up with a team mission.

Name | Description | Mission
-----| ----------- | --------
Viserion | Merchant Experience, focused on retention and customer experience for active Shippo customers | TBD
[Saiyan](https://github.com/goshippo/getting-started/blob/master/teams/growth.md) | Growth, focused on new user registration, activation and fraud prevention | `We help merchants succeed by making their Shippo experience both intuitive and delightful`
Hydra | Core, focused on high performance, high scale core services such as rating engine, data pipeline, tracking services | TBD
C-OPS | Carrier Ops, focused on integrations with our carrier partners such as USPS, Fedex, UPS, DHL and others | TBD
